					Following the success of our <a href="/2019/">2019 event</a>, the University of Sheffield (Sheffield, United Kingdom) is pleased to announce that we will be hosting the 2020 online GPU Hackathon as part of the <a href ="https://www.gpuhackathons.org/">international GPU Hackathon Series</a>. This event will take place July 27th - 31st, 2020 most likely as an online event unless government restrictions around COVID-19 are significantly altered. <a href="https://www.gpuhackathons.org/blog/taking-gpu-hackathons-digital">NVIDIA are committed to ensuring that developer and research communities can still participate in our GPU Hackathons and Bootcamps, enabling them to develop the hands-on skills needed to leverage GPUs to accelerate their scientific codes</a>. Prior GPU experience is not required, as those selected will be paired with experienced mentors who will teach them how to leverage accelerated computing in their own applications or further optimize their codes.

			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				General-purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) potentially offer exceptionally high memory bandwidth and performance for a wide range of applications. A challenge in utilizing such accelerators has been learning how to program them. These hackathons are intended to help overcome this challenge for new GPU programmers and also to help existing GPU programmers to further optimize their applications - a great opportunity for graduate students and postdocs. Any and all GPU programming paradigms are welcome.
			</p>

			<p>
				There will be intensive mentoring during this 5-day hands-on virtual workshop, with the goal that the teams leave with applications running on GPUs, or at least with a clear roadmap of how to get there. Each team will be assigned mentors from universities, national laboratories, supercomputing centers, industry partners, and <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html">NVIDIA</a> who have extensive experience in programming GPUs. Teams will work with assigned mentors virtual prior to the hackathon and for the week of the hackathon. Programming experience with CUDA is not a requirement although training can be offered in advance of the event.

			<h2>Who can apply</h2>
			<ul>
			<p>
				We are looking for teams of 3-5 developers, ideally postdocs, research software engineers (RSEs) or graduate students with a scalable application to port to (or optimize on) GPU accelerators.
			</p>
				
			<p>
				Collectively, the team should know the application intimately.
