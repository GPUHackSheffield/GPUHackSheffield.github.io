          Take the Piccadilly Line to Kings Cross/St Pancras. This takes about
          an hour. (You can knock 20 minutes off the journey time by taking the
          Heathrow Express to Paddington and then the Hammersmith & City or
          Circle Line to Kings Cross/St Pancras.) Trains for Sheffield leave
          from St Pancras twice an hour and take between 2 hours and 2 hours 15
          minutes. If you have time at St Pancras step outside on to the Euston
          Road to see one of the wonders of Railway Age architecture.

        <h3>From Sheffield Station to Halifax Hall or Jonas Hotel</h3>
        <p>
          When you arrive you will need to check in at Halifax Hall  or Jonas hotel or , if you are staying there. The simplest way to get from the station is by taxi. The fare should be between £6-8. Overseas visitors please
          note that British taxi drivers expect a 10% tip.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        If you prefer to travel by bus, cross the road outside the station and
        follow the signs to Sheffield Transport Interchange (it is a very short
        walk). Here you can get the <em>120</em> bus. Thanks to the wonders of
        privatisation this service is run by two different companies who follow
        different routes. Only the buses operated by First South Yorkshire go to
        Endcliffe Village. Don't take a bus operated by Stagecoach. The First
        South Yorkshire <em>120</em>, stops at the junction of Fulwood Road and Shore
        Lane. You can access Endcliffe Village by walking back along Fulwood
        Road and turning right on Endcliffe Crescent. Alternatively you can take
        the <em>70</em> bus. This is slightly more convenient for Halifax Hall. It leaves
        from the junction of Pond St and Harmer St at the corner of the
        Interchange and goes along Brocco Bank (bottom right of Endcliffe
        Village map, continuation of Westbourne Rd).
